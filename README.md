# Jupyter Notebooks and Tutorials

This provides the source for a set of notebooks.  Where possible it contains both the Jupyter notebook and the [Weave.jl](https://github.com/mpastell/Weave.jl), [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), or [Pweave](http://mpastell.com/pweave/) source.

Many of the notebooks themselves will be posted on [QuantEcon Notes](https://notes.quantecon.org)

Major sections:

- [Continuous Time Methods](continuous_time_method/README.md): implementations of upwind finite-difference methods
- [General Julia](general_julia/README.md): an assortment of notebooks and examples not easily categorized in the other sections.
